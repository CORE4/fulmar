# This is a basic Fulmarfile. You can add task just like in Rake. Additionally, you can
# use helper to modify the ssh config, open a shell locally or remote, or upload files to a preconfigured host
# All paths and hostname are configured in Fulmar/project.config.yml. You can split you configuration over multiple
# *.config.yml files which are all merged. You can create additional .rake files within the Fulmar directory.
# For more help, look at https://github.com/CORE4/fulmar
